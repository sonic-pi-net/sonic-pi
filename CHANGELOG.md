# History

## Version 2.3.0
*To be released*

### Breaking Changes

* Playing chords with the fn `chord` now divides the amplitiude of each
  resulting synth by the number of notes in the chord. This ensures the
  resulting amplitude isn't excessive and is normalised.
* Chords now evaluate their args once and those args are used for all
  synth triggers. This means random values are only generated once and
  are similar across all notes in the chord. Previous behviour can be
  obtained by calling play multiple times with now interleaved sleeps.
* Ensure each new thread's random number generator is unique yet seeded
  in a deterministic manner. This stops random vals across `at` from
  being identical.
* `range` is now exclusive: `(range 1, 5) #=> (ring 1, 2, 3, 4)`

### New

* New fn `density` for compressing and repeating time. For example,
  wrapping some code with a call to density of 2 will double the bpm for
  that block as well as repeating it twice. This ensures the block takes
  the same amount of time to execute while doing double the work.
* New fns `with_bpm_mul` and `use_bpm_mul` which will multiply the
  current bpm by a specified amount. Useful for slowing down and
  speeding up the execution of a specific thread or live_loop.
* New fn `rdist` - generate a radom number with a centred distribution
* New examples: square skit, shufflit and tilburg

### Improvements

* Teach control to ignore nil nodes i.e. `control nil, amp: 3` will do
  nothing.
* Teach Float#times to yield a float to the block. For example,
  `3.4.times {|v| puts v}` will yield `0.0`, `1.0` and `2.0`.
* Synth, Sample and FX args now handle bools and nil correctly. `true`
  resolves to `1.0` and `false`, `nil` resolve to `0.0`. This allows you
  to write code such as: `play :e3, invert_wave: true`
* Teach `at` to handle varying block arities differently. See docs for
  more detail. Original behaviour is preserved and only extended. 
* App now checks for updates (at most once every 2 weeks). This may be
  disabled in the prefs.
* Teach `:reverb` FX to extend its kill delay time with larger room
  sizes to reduce the chance of clipping.
 

### Synth & FX

* New FX `bitcrusher` - for crunching and destroying those hi-fi sounds.
* New FX `flanger` - a classic swhooshing effect typically used with
  vocals and guitars.
* New FX `ring` - ring modulation for that friendly Dalek sound

### New Samples

* `perc_snap` - a finger snap
* `perc_snap2` - another finger snap
* `bd_ada` - a bass drum
* `guit_em9` - a lovely guitar arpegio over Em9

### Bug Fixes

* Namespace `live_loop` fn and thread names to stop them clashing with
  standard user defined threads and fns.
* GUI no longer crashes when you start a line with a symbol.
* `with_fx` now returns the result of the block
* Kill zombie scsynth servers on startup for better crash recovery.
* Handle paths with UTF8 characters gracefully
* Force sample rate for output and input to 44k on OS X. This stops
  scsynth from crashing when output and input sample rates were
  different.

 ## Version 2.2.0 
 *Thursday 18th December, 2014*
[(view commits)](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.2.0)

This release brings a number of nice enhancements. However the main
feature is the accurate timing for triggering FX. This means you can now
reliably use FX for accurate rhythmic purposes such as wobbling, slicing
and echoes.

### Breaking Changes

* `use_sample_pack_as` now uses a double underscore `__` as a separator
  between the user-specified alias and the sample name.

### API Changes

* Teach synth args to take prefixed maps: `play 50, {amp: 0.5}, {release: 2}, amp: 2`
* Don't round Floats when user specifically prints them to log with puts
* `with_fx` FX synths are now triggered using virtual time rather than
  real time. This means that FX can now be used for rhythmical purposes.
* Work on new `RingArray` datastructure. This is essentially an array
  that wraps its indexes so you can use indexes larger than the array size.
* New fn `ring` - `(ring 1, 2, 3)` creates a new ring array.
* New fn `knit` - `(knit :a1, 2, :c1, 1)` returns `(ring :a1, :a1, :c1)` 
* New fn `bools` - `(bools 1, 0, 1)` returns `(ring true, false, true)`
* New fn `range` - `(range 70, 100, 10)` returns `(ring 70, 80, 90, 100)`
* New fn `sample_loaded?` - to detect whether a specific sample has been loaded

### Synth & FX

* Fixed regression in `:tb303` synth - sound is reverted to v2.0 behaviour
* New Synth - `:square` - Pure square wave

### GUI

* Help system now autodocks on close
* Preferences are now remembered across sessions
* On Raspberry Pi, previous volume and audio output options are forced
  on boot.

### New Samples

* `bd_tek` - Bass drum

### Bug fixes

* `one_in` now returns false if num is < 1
* Ensure `live_loop`'s no-sleep detector works within nested `with_fx` blocks
* `chord` now returns a ring.

## Version 2.1.1

## Version 2.1
*Friday 21st November, 2014*
[(view commits)](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi/commits/v2.1.0)

The focus of release is very much on technical improvements, efficiency
and general polish. 

The most obvious and exciting change is the introduction of the
`live_loop` which will change the way you work with Sonic Pi. For more
information on `live_loop` take a look at the new section in the
tutorial. Another very exciting development is that v2.1 marks the
official support for Windows thanks to the excellent work by Jeremy
Weatherford. Finally, this release is also the first release where Sonic
Pi has a Core Team of developers. Please give a warm welcome to Xavier
Riley, Jeremy Weatherford and Joseph Wilk.


### API Changes
* New fn `live_loop` - A loop for live coding
* New fn `inc` - increment
* New fn `dec` - decrement
* New fn `quantise` - quantise a value to resolution
* New fn `factor?` - Factor test
* New fn `at` - Run a block at the given times
* New fn `degree` - for resolving a note in a scale by degree such as `:i`, `:iv`
* New fn `chord_degree` - Construct chords based on scale degrees
* New TL fn `use_sample_bpm` - for changing the BPM based on a sample's duration
* New fn `rest?` - Determine if note or args is a rest
* New fn `vt` - Get virtual time
* New fn `set_control_delta!` - Set control delta globally
* `wait` now handles both `sleep` and `sync` functionality 
* Allow first arg to `play` to be a proc or lambda. In which case simple call it and use the result as the note
* Teach `play` to accept a single map argument (in which case it will extract `:note` key out if it exists.
* Fns `play` and `synth` now treat 'notes' `nil`, `:r` and `:rest` as rests and don't trigger any synths. 


### GUI Modifications

* Updated and improved tutorial
