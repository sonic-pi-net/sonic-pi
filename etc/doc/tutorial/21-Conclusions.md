# Conclusions

This concludes the Sonic Pi introductory tutorial. Hopefully you've learned something along the way. Don't worry if you feel you didn't understand everything - just play and have fun and you'll pick things up along the way. Feel free to dive back in when you have a question that might be covered in one of the sections.

If you have any questions that haven't been covered in the tutorial, then please jump onto the Sonic Pi forums http://groups.google.com/group/sonic-pi/ and ask your question there. You'll find someone friendly and willing to lend a hand. 

Finally, I also invite you to take a deeper look at the rest of the documentation in this help system. There are a number of features that haven't been covered in this tutorial that are waiting for your discovery. 

So, play, have fun, share your code, perform for your friends and remember: 

*There are no mistakes, only opportunities*
