# Sonic Pi

## A free sound synthesiser built to allow everyone to live code music.

Sonic Pi is an open source programming environment designed to explore
and teach programming concepts through the process of creating new
sounds. Sonic Pi comes with an associated scheme of work which
emphasises the importance of creativity in the learning process and
gives users the control to turn their sonic ideas into reality.
