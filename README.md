## The Live Coding Synth for Everyone.

Sonic Pi is a new kind of musical instrument. Instead of strumming
strings or whacking things with sticks - you write code - live.

Sonic Pi has been designed with the aim to find a harmonious balance
between three core principles:

* *Simple* enough for the 10 year old within you
* *Joyful* enough for you to lose yourself through play
* *Powerful* enough for your own expressions

Sonic Pi is a complete open source programming environment originally
designed to explore and **teach programming concepts** within schools through 
the process of creating **new sounds**. 

In addition to being an engaging education resource it has evolved into 
an **extremely powerful** and performance-ready **live coding instrument** suitable 
for professional artists and DJs.

Whilst Education is a core focus it now sits at the intersection
between three core domains:

* *Art*
* *Technology*
* *Education* 

Again, finding a balance working to the best benefits of all these
domains is the objective.
