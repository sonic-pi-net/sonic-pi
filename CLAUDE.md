# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor) working in **sonic-pi**.

<!-- TODO: one paragraph — what this project is, who it serves, and what "done" looks like here. -->

## Stack & commands

<!-- TODO: fill in the real commands; delete rows that don't apply. -->

```bash
# install dependencies:
# run the dev server / build:
# run tests:
# lint:
```

## Conventions

- Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description` (`feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`refactor`/`test`/`chore`/`ci`).
- Default branch is `dev` — branch from it and open a PR; never push to it directly.
- README-First, README-Last: read the nearest `README.md` before changing a
  directory, and update it after.
- Don't suppress type errors (`as any`, `@ts-ignore`, `# type: ignore`) or
  leave empty exception handlers.

## Fleet context

This repo is one of ~40 managed by the [bamr87/bamr87 dash](https://github.com/bamr87/bamr87) (registry: `_data/projects.yml`; tiered baseline: `docs/STANDARDS.md`). It is vendored there as a git submodule: commit and push changes **here** first — the hub only bumps its pointer afterwards. Shared CI, release, schema, and agent kits are seeded from the hub's `templates/`; prefer adopting those over hand-rolling equivalents.
