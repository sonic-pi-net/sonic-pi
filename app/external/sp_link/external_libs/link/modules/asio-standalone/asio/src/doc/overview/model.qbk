[section:model Asynchronous Model]

This section presents a high-level overview of the asynchronous model at the
core of the Asio library. This model enshrines asynchronous operations as the
fundamental building block of asynchronous composition, but in a way that
decouples them from the composition mechanism. The asynchronous operations in
Asio support callbacks, futures (both eager and lazy), fibers, coroutines, and
approaches yet to be imagined. This allows the application programmer to select
an approach based on appropriate trade-offs.
