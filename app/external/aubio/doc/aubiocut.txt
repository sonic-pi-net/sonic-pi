NAME
  aubiocut - a command line tool to slice sound files at onset or beat timestamps

SYNOPSIS

  aubiocut source
  aubiocut [[-i] source]
           [-r rate] [-B win] [-H hop]
           [-O method] [-t thres]
           [-b] [-c]
           [-v] [-q] [-h]

OPTIONS

  This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
  starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.

  -i, --input source  Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
  compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

  -r, --samplerate rate  Fetch the input source, resampled at the given
  sampling rate. The rate should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If set
  to 0, the sampling rate of the original source will be used. Defaults to 0.

  -B, --bufsize win  The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
  of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 512.

  -H, --hopsize hop  The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
  Defaults to 256.

  -O, --onset method  The onset detection method to use. See ONSET METHODS
  below. Defaults to 'default'.

  -b, --beat  Use beat locations instead of onset locations.

  -t, --onset-threshold thres  Set the threshold value for the onset peak
  picking. Values are typically in the range [0.001, 0.900]. Lower threshold
  values imply more onsets detected. Increasing this threshold should reduce
  the number of incorrect detections. Defaults to 0.3.

  -c, --cut  Cut input sound file at detected labels. A new sound files for
  each slice will be created in the current directory.

  -o, --output directory  Specify the directory path where slices of the
  original source should be created.

  --cut-until-nsamples n  How many extra samples should be added at the end of
  each slice (default 0).

  --cut-until-nslices n  How many extra slices should be added at the end of
  each slice (default 0).

  --create-first  Alway create first slice.

  -h, --help  Print a short help message and exit.

  -v, --verbose  Be verbose.

  -q, --quiet  Be quiet.
