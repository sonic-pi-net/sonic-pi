             [-p method] [-u unit] [-l thres]

             [-j] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

  aubionotes attempts to detect notes by looking for note onsets and pitches.
  Consecutive events are segmented using onset detection, while a fundamental
  frequency extraction algorithm determines their pitch.

  When started with an input source (-i/--input), the detected notes are
  printed on standard output, in seconds and midi note number.

  When started without an input source, or with the jack option (-j/--jack),
  aubionotes starts in jack mode.

OPTIONS

  This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
  starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.

  -i, --input source  Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
  compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

  -r, --samplerate rate  Fetch the input source, resampled at the given
  sampling rate. The rate should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0,
  the sampling rate of the original source will be used. Defaults to 0.

  -B, --bufsize win  The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
  of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 512.

  -H, --hopsize hop  The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
  Defaults to 256.

  -O, --onset method  The onset detection method to use. See ONSET METHODS
  below. Defaults to 'default'.

  -t, --onset-threshold thres  Set the threshold value for the onset peak
  picking. Typical values are typically within 0.001 and 0.900. Defaults to
  0.1. Lower threshold values imply more onsets detected. Try 0.5 in case of
  over-detections. Defaults to 0.3.

  -M, --minioi value  Set the minimum inter-onset interval, in seconds, the
  shortest interval between two consecutive notes. Defaults to 0.030

  -p, --pitch method  The pitch detection method to use. See PITCH METHODS
  below. Defaults to 'default'.

  -u, --pitch-unit unit  The unit to be used to print frequencies. Possible
  values include midi, bin, cent, and Hz. Defaults to 'Hz'.

  -l, --pitch-tolerance thres  Set the tolerance for the pitch detection
  algorithm. Typical values range between 0.2 and 0.9. Pitch candidates found
  with a confidence less than this threshold will not be selected. The higher
  the threshold, the more confidence in the candidates. Defaults to unset.

  -s, --silence sil  Set the silence threshold, in dB, under which the pitch
  will not be detected. A value of -20.0 would eliminate most onsets but the
  loudest ones. A value of -90.0 would select all onsets. Defaults to -90.0.

  -d, --release-drop  Set the release drop threshold, in dB. If the level drops
  more than this amount since the last note started, the note will be turned
  off. Defaults to 10.

  -T, --timeformat format  Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to
  seconds.

  -j, --jack  Use Jack input/output. You will need a Jack connection
  controller to feed aubio some signal and listen to its output.

  -h, --help  Print a short help message and exit.

  -v, --verbose  Be verbose.
