As a special exception, including TLSF header files in a file, or linking with
other files objects to produce an executable application, is merely considered
normal use of the library, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived
work". Therfore does not by itself cause the resulting executable application
to be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered
by the GNU Public License.
