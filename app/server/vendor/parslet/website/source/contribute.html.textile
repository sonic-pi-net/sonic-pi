h2. Contact

Join us on IRC in #parslet on irc.freenode.net.

go to our mailing list at
"ruby.parslet@librelist.com":mailto:ruby.parslet@librelist.com. Just write a
short message to that address and "librelist":http://librelist.com will
subscribe you. NNTP/web interface can be had through

<code>gmane.comp.lang.ruby.parslet</code>.

h2. Bugs 

Log in to github and open a bug ticket
"here":https://github.com/kschiess/parslet/issues. Please be sure to include
the version of parslet and Ruby; maybe you can even provide some code that
exhibits the bug?

And of course if you provide a properly tested patch, you'll be our hero and 
get a place in the space below for lifetime. 

h2. Projects

Have you got a project that uses parslet? Please write
"us":mailto:kaspar.schiess@absurd.li about it. 

"*edn-ruby*":https://github.com/relevance/edn-ruby

edn-ruby is a Ruby library to read and write "edn":https://github.com/edn-format/edn 
(extensible data notation), a subset of Clojure used for transferring data between 
applications, much like JSON, YAML, or XML.

"*Examples*":https://github.com/kschiess/parslet/tree/master/example/

In here, you can find a parser for a lisp like language and much more. 

"*Net::HTTP::Server*":https://github.com/postmodern/net-http-server

A really small and elegant HTTP server written in Ruby. Think Webrick. Using
parslet. (Postmodern)

"*regexador*":https://github.com/Hal9000/regexador

An external DSL for Ruby that tries to make regular expressions readable and maintainable. (Hal Fulton)

"*self-ml*":https://github.com/self-ml/selfml

A "self-ml":http://self-ml.github.io/ implementation using parslet. 
(Ricardo Mendes)

"*thnad*":https://github.com/undees/thnad 

Thnad is a tiny programming language with so few features that it is not
useful for anything at all -- except showing how to write a compiler in half
an hour.

A variant of Chris Pound's word generator written in Ruby, with some
improvements. (Robert Kosek)

h2. Thanks for all the fish -- Contributions

* *Rory O’Kane* ("roryokane":https://github.com/roryokane) for a careful code 
  review!

* *Zach Moazeni* ("zmoazeni":https://github.com/zmoazeni) for his work on
  Unicode performance.

* *rogerbraun* ("rogerbraun":https://github.com/rogerbraun) for being my
  unicode tester. 

* *meh* ("meh":http://meh.paranoid.pk/) for taking a real close look. 

* *John Mettraux* ("jmettraux":http://jmettraux.wordpress.com/) for the really
  nice JSON example and for pushing parslet beyond its limits.

* *Josep M. Bach* ("txus":http://www.txustice.me/) for minding the small 
  things that make a big difference.

* *Matthew Draper* ("matthewd":http://matthewd.net/) for bothering with my 
  broken CSS.

* *Hal Brodigan* ("postmodern":http://postmodern.github.com/) for solving our

* *Florian Hanke* ("floere":http://floere.github.com) has given a lot of very
  inspiring input for parslet. His questions have been key to rounding off the
  corners and making the library as aesthetic as it is. And just look at the 
  logo. 
  
* *Kaspar Schiess* ("absurd.li":http://www.absurd.li) for being brave enough
  to actually add another parser library to a field that's already bursting
  at the seams.
