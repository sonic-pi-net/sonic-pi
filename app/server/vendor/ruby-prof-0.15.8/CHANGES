0.7.3 (2008-12-09)
========================
* Fixed compile error with new x86_64 code using GCC.

0.7.2 (2008-12-08)
========================
* Fixed major bug in printing child methods in graph reports.

* Fixes for supporting x86_64 machines (Diego Pettenò)


0.7.1 (2008-11-28)
========================
* Added new AggregateCallInfo class for printers to
  make results easier to read.  Take this call sequence
  for example:

   A   B   C
   |   |   |
   Z   A   A
       |   |
       Z   Z

  By default, ruby-prof will show that Z was called by 3 separate
  instances of A.  In an IDE that is helpful but in a text report
  it is not since it makes the report much harder to read.
  As a result, printers now aggregate together callers (and children),
  matching ruby-prof's output from versions prior to 0.7.0.

* Fixes for supporting x86_64 machines (Matt Sanford)


0.7.0 (2008-11-04)
========================

Features
--------
* Added two new methods - RubyProf.resume and RubyProf.pause.
  RubyProf.resume takes an optional block, which ensures that
  RubyProf.pause is called.  For example:

  10.times do |i|
    RubyProf.resume do
      # Some long process
    end
  end

  result = RubyProf.stop

* Added support for profiling tests that use Ruby's built-in
  unit test framework (ie, test derived from
  Test::Unit::TestCase).  To enable profiling simply add
  the following line of code to your test class:

    include RubyProf::Test

  By default, profiling results are written to the current
  processes working directory.  To change this, or other
  profiling options, simply modify the PROFILE_OPTIONS hash
  table as needed.

* Used the new support for profiling test cases to revamp
  the way that Rails profiling works.  For more information
  please refer to RubyProf's documentation.

* Keep track of call stack for each method to enable more
  powerful profile visualizations in Integrated Development
  Environments (Hin Boean, work supported by CodeGear).

* Expose measurements to Ruby (Jeremy Kemper).

* Add support for additional memory measurements modes in Ruby 1.9 (Jeremy Kemper).

* Add support for Lloyd Hilaiel's Ruby patch for measuring total heap size.
   See http://lloydforge.org/projects/ruby. (Jeremy Kemper).


Fixes
-------
* RubyProf.profile no longer crashes if an exception is
  thrown during a profiling run.

* Measure memory in fractional kilobytes rather than rounding down (Jeremy Kemper)


0.6.0 (2008-02-03)
========================

Features
--------
* Added support for ruby 1.9 (Shugo Maeda)
* Added support for outputting printer results to a String, Array or IO
  object (Michael Granger)
* Add new memory profiling mode.  Note this mode depends on a
  patched Ruby interpreter (Alexander Dymo)

Fixes
-------
* Improvements to GraphHtmlPrinter including updated documentation,
  fixes for min_time support, ability to specify templates using
  strings or filenames, and table layout fixes (Makoto Kuwata)
* Fixes to scaling factor for calltrees so that precision is not lost
  due to the conversion to doubles (Sylvain Joyeux)
* Changed constant ALLOCATED_OBJECTS to ALLOCATIONS in the C code to
  match the Ruby code (Sylvain Joyeux)
* Added support for calltree printer to ruby-prof binary script (Sylvain Joyeux)
* Fix support for the allocator measure mode to extconf.rb (Sylvain Joyeux)
* Honor measure mode when specified on the command line (Sylvain Joyeux)

* Fix tabs in erb template for graph html report on windows.

0.4.1 (2006-06-26)
========================

Features
--------
* Added a RubyProf.running? method to indicate whether a profile is in progress.
* Added tgz and zip archives to release

Fixes
-------
* Duplicate method names are now allowed
* The documentation has been updated to show the correct API usage is RubyProf.stop not RubyProf.end

  GraphPrinter and GraphHtmlPrinter.

  way it was invoked - for example, it did not run when
  used with Arachno Ruby's customized version of Ruby.
