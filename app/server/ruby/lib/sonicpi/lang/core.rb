OSC (Open Sound Control) is a simple way of passing messages between two separate programs on the same computer or even on different computers via a local network or even the internet. `use_osc` allows you to specify which computer (`hostname`) and program (`port`) to send messages to.

It is possible to send messages to the same computer by using the host name `\"localhost\"`.

This is a thread-local setting - therefore each thread (or live loop) can have their own separate `use_osc` values.

Note that calls to `osc_send` will ignore these values.

OSC (Open Sound Control) is a simple way of passing messages between two separate programs on the same computer or even on different computers via a local network or even the internet. `osc` enables you to send well-timed OSC messages from within Sonic Pi. `osc` will ensure that the OSC message is sent at the correct time using the same timing system shared with the synthesis functionality via `sample`, `synth` and friends. `osc` even works seamlessly within `time_warp` - see examples.

A typical OSC message has two parts: a descriptive `path` which looks similar to a URL (website address), and an optional list of `arguments` that are either numbers or strings.

For example, a hypothetical synth program might accept this OSC message:

`/set/filter lowpass 80 0.5`

where `/set/filter` is the path, and `lowpass`, `80`, and `0.5` are three
arguments. This can be sent from within Sonic Pi by writing:

`osc \"/set/filter\", \"lowpass\", 80, 0.5`

However, in order to send the OSC message you must first specify where to send it to. This is achieved by specifying both the host (the machine's internet address) and the port that the remote OSC server is listening on. This is configured using `use_osc` or `with_osc`. So, if our synth program was running on a machine on the local network with IP address `10.0.1.5` on port `5100` we could send our OSC message to it with the following:


`use_osc \"10.0.1.5\", 5100`

`osc \"/set/filter\", \"lowpass\", 80, 0.5`


Note, by default, Sonic Pi listens for OSC messages on port `4560`, so you may send messages to an external machine running Sonic Pi if you know the IP address of that external machine. Any OSC messages received on port `4560` are automatically converted to standard cue events and displayed in the GUI's cue log. This also means that you can use `sync` to wait for the next incoming OSC message with a given path (see example).

Finally, it is also very useful to send OSC messages to other programs on the same computer. This can be achieved by specifying \"localhost\" as the hostname and the port as normal (depending on which port the other program is listening on).

See `osc_send` for a version which allows you to specify the hostname and port directly (ignoring any values set via `use_osc` or `with_osc`).

For example, if the delta value is 0.1 then all code within the block is executed with a 0.1 beat delay. Negative values are allowed which means you can move a block of code *backwards in time*. For example a delta value of -0.1 will execute the code in the block 0.1 beats ahead of time. The time before the block started is restored after the execution of the block.

Given a list of times, run the block once after waiting each given time. If passed an optional params list, will pass each param individually to each block call. If size of params list is smaller than the times list, the param values will act as rings (rotate through). If the block is given 1 arg, the times are fed through. If the block is given 2 args, both the times and the params are fed through. A third block arg will receive the index of the time.

Note that the code within the block is executed synchronously with the code before and after, so all thread locals will be modified inline - as is the case for `with_fx`. However, as time is always restored to the value before `time_warp` started, you can use it to schedule events for the future in a similar fashion to a thread (via `at` or `in_thread`) without having to use an entirely fresh and distinct set of thread locals - see examples.

Also, note that you cannot travel backwards in time beyond the `current_sched_ahead_time`.

If the `time_warp` block is within a `density` block, the delta time is not affected (although all the other times such as sleep and phase durations will be affected) - see example.

`time_warp` is ahead-of-time scheduling within the current thread. See `at` for just-in-time scheduling using multiple isolated threads.",

          doc:            "Loop the do/end block forever. However, unlike a basic loop, a live_loop has two special properties. Firstly it runs in a thread - so you can have any number of live loops running at the same time (concurrently). Secondly, you can change the behaviour of a live loop whilst it is still running without needing to stop it. Live loops are therefore the secret to live coding with Sonic Pi.

As live loops are excecuted within a named in_thread, they behave similarly. See the in_thread documentation for all the details. However, it's worth mentioning a few important points here. Firstly, only one live loop with a given name can run at any one time. Therefore, if you define two or more `live_loop`s called `:foo` only one will be running. Another important aspect of `live_loop`s is that they manage their own thread locals set with the `use_*` and `with_*` fns. This means that each `live_loop` can have its own separate default synth, BPM and sample defaults. When a `live_loop` is *first* created, it inherits the thread locals from the parent thread, but once it has started, the only way to change them is by re-defining the do/end body of the `live_loop`. See the examples below for details. Finally, as mentioned above, provided their names are different, you may have many `live_loop`s executing at once.

A typical way of live coding with live loops is to define a number of them in a buffer, hit Run to start them and then to modify their do/end blocks and then hit Run again. This will not create any more thread, but instead just modify the behaviour of the existing threads. The changes will *not* happen immediately. Instead, they will only happen the next time round the loop. This is because the behaviour of each live loop is implemented with a standard function. When a live loop is updated, the function definition is also updated. Each time round the live loop, the function is called, so the new behviour is only observed next time round the loop.

Also sends a `cue` with the same name each time the `live_loop` repeats. This may be used to `sync` with other threads and `live_loop`s.

If the `live_loop` block is given a parameter, this is given the result of the last run of the loop (with initial value either being `0` or an init arg). This allows you to 'thread' values across loops.

Finally, it is possible to delay the initial trigger of the live_loop on creation with both the `delay:` and `sync:` opts. See their respective docstrings. If both `delay:` and `sync:` are specified, on initial live_loop creation first the delay will be honoured and then the sync.

`:white` is totally random - between 0 and 1, you can expect an even spread of values around 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 etc. This means that jumping around within the range (including large jumps) is expected.

`:pink` is more likely to produce values in the middle of the range and less likely to produce values at the extremes. Between 0 and 1 you expect to see a concentration of values around 0.5. This can make random melodies a little bit more smooth.

`:perlin` is a special kind of noise which produces gradients, a bit like a mountain landscape. Large jumps are much less likely and you will tend to see lots of smooth motion going either up or down

`:light_pink` is halfway between white noise and pink noise - more random and jumpy

`:dark_pink` is halfway between pink noise and brown noise - less jumpy with smoother slopes

You can see the 'buckets' that the numbers between 0 and 1 fall into with the following code:
