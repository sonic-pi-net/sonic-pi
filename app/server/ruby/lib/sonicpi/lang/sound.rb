          doc:            "Create a named synthesiser which works similar to `play`, `sample` or `synth`. Rather than synthesising the sound mathematically or playing back recorded audio, it streams audio live from your sound card.

However, unlike `play`, `sample` and `synth`, which allow multiple similar synths to play at the same time (i.e. a chord) only one `live_audio` synth of a given name may exist in the system at any one time. This is similar to `live_loop` where only one live loop of each name may exist at any one time. See examples for further information.

An additional difference is that `live_audio` will create an infinitely long synth rather than be timed to an envelope like the standard `synth` and `sample` synths. This is particularly suitable for working with continuous incoming audio streams where the source of the audio is unknown (for example, it may be a guitar, an analog synth or an electronic violin). If the source is continuous, then it may not be suited to being stitched together by successive enveloped calls to something like: `synth :sound_in, attack: 0, sustain: 4, release: 0`. If we were to `live_loop` this with a `sleep 4` to match the sustain duration, we would get something that emulated a continuous stream, but for certain inputs you'll hear clicking at the seams between each successive call to `synth` where the final part of the audio signal from the previous synth doesn't precisely match up with the start of the signal in the next synth due to very minor timing differences.

Another important feature of `live_audio` is that it will automatically move an existing `live_audio` synth into the current FX context. This means you can live code the FX chain around the live stream and it will update automatically. See examples.

To stop a `live_audio` synth, use the `:stop` arg: `live_audio :foo, :stop`.

If note: opt is `nil`, `:r` or `:rest`, play is ignored and treated as a rest. Also, if the `on:` opt is specified and returns `false`, or `nil` then play is similarly ignored and treated as a rest.

If the synth name is `nil` behaviour is identical to that of `play` in that the `current_synth` will determine the actual synth triggered.

If a block is given, it is assumed to take one arg which will be the controllable synth node and the body of the block is run in an implicit `in_thread`. This allows for asynchronous control of the synth without interfering with time. For synchronous control capture the result of `synth` as a variable and use that.

Note that the default opts listed are only a guide to the most common opts across all the synths.

          summary:       "Trigger sample",
          doc:           "Play back a recorded sound file (sample). Sonic Pi comes with lots of great samples included (see the section under help) but you can also load and play `.wav`, `.wave`, `.aif`, `.aiff`, `.ogg`, `.oga` or `.flac` files from anywhere on your computer too. To play a built-in sample use the corresponding keyword such as `sample :bd_haus`. To play any file on your computer use a full path such as `sample \"/path/to/sample.wav\"`.

There are many opts for manipulating the playback. For example, the `rate:` opt affects both the speed and the pitch of the playback. To control the rate of the sample in a pitch-meaningful way take a look at the `rpitch:` opt.

The sampler synth has three separate envelopes - one for amplitude, one for a low pass filter and another for a high pass filter. These work very similar to the standard synth envelopes except for two major differences. Firstly, the envelope times do not stretch or shrink to match the BPM. Secondly, the sustain time by default stretches to make the envelope fit the length of the sample. This is explained in detail in the tutorial.

Samples are loaded on-the-fly when first requested (and subsequently remembered). If the sample loading process takes longer than the schedule ahead time, the sample trigger will be skipped rather than be played late and out of time. To avoid this you may preload any samples you wish to work with using `load_sample` or `load_samples`.

It is possible to set the `start:` and `finish:` positions within the sample to play only a sub-section of it. These values can be automatically chosen based on an onset detection algorithm which will essentially isolate each individual drum or synth hit in the sample and let you access each one by an integer index (floats will be rounded to the nearest integer value). See the `onset:` docstring and examples for more information.

Finally, the sampler supports a powerful filtering system to make it easier to work with large folders of samples. The filter commands must be used before the first standard opt. There are six kinds of filter parameters you may use:

1. Folder strings - `\"/foo/bar\"` - which will add all samples within the folder to the set of candidates.
2. Recursive folder strings - `\"/foo/bar/**\"` - Folder strings ending with `**` will add all samples contained within all subfolders (searched recursively).
3. Sample strings - `\"/path/to/sample.wav\"` - which will add the specific sample to the set of candidates.
4. Other strings - `\"foobar\"` - which will filter the candidates based on whether the filename contains the string.
5. Regular expressions - `/b[aA]z.*/` - which will filter the candidates based on whether the regular expression matches the filename.
6. Keywords - `:quux` - will filter the candidates based on whether the keyword is a direct match of the filename (without extension).
7. Numbers - `0` - will select the candidate with that index (wrapping round like a ring if necessary).
8. Lists of the above - `[\"/foo/bar\", \"baz\", /0-9.*/]` - will recurse down and work through the internal filter parameters as if they were in the top level.
9. Lambdas - `lambda {|s| [s.choose] }` - the ultimate power tool for filters. Allows you to create a custom fn which receives a list of candidates as an arg and which should return a new list of candidates (this may be smaller, larger, re-ordered it's up to you).

By combining commands which add to the candidates and then filtering those candidates it is possible to work with folders full of samples in very powerful ways. Note that the specific ordering of filter parameters is irrelevant with the exception of the numbers - in which case the last number is the index. All the candidates will be gathered first before the filters are applied.

## Important notes

The binary file containing the synth design must have the extension `.scsyndef`.

You may not trigger external synthdefs unless you enable the following GUI preference:

```
Studio -> Synths and FX -> Enable external synths and FX
```

If you wish your synth to work with Sonic Pi's automatic stereo sound infrastructure *you need to ensure your synth outputs a stereo signal* to an audio bus with an index specified by a synth arg named `out_bus`. Also, Sonic Pi makes no automatic attempt to free a synth once triggered, so to behave like the built-in synths, your synth needs to automatically free itself. For example, the following synth would work nicely:


    (
    SynthDef(\\piTest,
             {|freq = 200, amp = 1, out_bus = 0 |
               Out.ar(out_bus,
