This effect is created using the pulse ugen which produces a variable width square wave. We then control the width of the pulses using a variety of LFOs - sin-osc and lf-tri in this case. We use a number of these LFO modulated pulse ugens with varying LFO type and rate (and phase in some cases) to provide the LFO with a different starting point. We then mix all these pulses together to create a thick sound and then feed it through a resonant low pass filter (rlpf). For extra bass, one of the pulses is an octave lower (half the frequency) and its LFO has a little bit of randomisation thrown into its frequency component for that extra bit of variety.

The pan changes: When the horns point sideways, they sound louder on the side they point to.

Be warned, `:ping_pong` FX with very long phases can consume a lot of memory and take longer to initialise. Also, large values for feedback will cause the echo to last for a very long time.
