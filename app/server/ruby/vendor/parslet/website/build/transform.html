        <h1>Transformation</h1><p>Parslet parsers output deep nested hashes. Those are nice for printing, but 
hard to work with. The structure of the nested hashes is determined by the
grammar and can thus vary largely. Testing for the presence of individual 
keys would produce code that is hard to read and maintain.</p>
<p>This is why parslet also comes with a hash transformation engine. To construct
such a transform, you have to derive from <code>Parslet::Transform</code>:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="simple transform">
  class MyTransform &lt; Parslet::Transform
    rule('a') { 'b' }
  end
  MyTransform.new.apply('a') # =&gt; "b"
</code></pre>
<p>This is a transformation that replaces all &#8217;a&#8217;s with &#8217;b&#8217;s. A transformation
rule has two parts: A <strong>pattern</strong> (here: <code>'a'</code>) and an <strong>action block</strong>
(<code>{ 'b' }</code>).</p>
<p>The engine will go through the input and traverse the tree in depth-first
post-order fashion. This means that for a given tree node, it will first visit
the children and only then look at the node itself. While traversing, all
rules are tested in the order in which they are defined. If a rule matches, the
corresponding tree is <em>replaced</em> by whatever the action block returns.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another way of saying the same thing, perhaps more in line with what
you need as a user of Parslet: <code>Parslet::Transform</code> is what allows
you to transform the <span class="caps">PORO</span>-trees magically into a real abstract syntax tree.
The rule definitions are the futuristic nano-machines that act on tree leaves
first, eating them away and replacing them with contraptions of your own
design. Here&#8217;s how that might look like in Ruby:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="poro magic">
  tree = {:left =&gt; {:int =&gt; '1'}, 
          :op   =&gt; '+', 
          :right =&gt; {:int =&gt; '2'}}
        
  class Trans &lt; Parslet::Transform
    rule(:int =&gt; simple(:x)) { Integer(x) }
  end
  Trans.new.apply(tree)     # =&gt; {:left=&gt;1, :op=&gt;"+", :right=&gt;2}
</code></pre>
<p>You can start thinking about the leaves first, transforming those <code>:int
=&gt; '1'</code> into real Ruby integers. This incremental (test driven!)
approach will prevent your intermediary tree from turning into grey goo
from too many nano-machines. Rules should in general be simple and transform
a small part of the tree into a more useful variant. Turns out that if we were
looking for an interpreter, one more rule will give us evaluation:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="building up">
  tree = {:left =&gt; {:int =&gt; '1'}, 
          :op   =&gt; '+', 
          :right =&gt; {:int =&gt; '2'}}

  class Trans &lt; Parslet::Transform
    rule(:int =&gt; simple(:x)) { Integer(x) }
    rule(:op =&gt; '+', :left =&gt; simple(:l), :right =&gt; simple(:r)) { l + r }
  end
  Trans.new.apply(tree)     # =&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p>Cool, isn&#8217;t it? To recap: parslet intentionally spits out deep nested hashes, 
because it also gives you the tool to work with those. Turning the intermediary
trees into something useful is really easy.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Working with Captures</h2>
<p>What is this <code>simple(symbol)</code> business all about, you might ask.
Glad you do.</p>
<h3>Simple captures</h3>
<p>Transform allows you to specify patterns that have wildcards in them. The
wildcards match part of the tree, but at the same time capture it for working
on it in your action block. The wildcard</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  simple(:x)
</code></pre>
<p>will match any object <span class="caps">BUT</span> hashes or arrays. While this is obviously useful
for capturing strings, you can also capture other &#8216;simple&#8217; (as opposed to 
composed) objects of your own creation. <code>simple(:x)</code> would thus match
all of these objects:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  "a string"
  123
  Foo.new(:some, :class, :instance)
</code></pre>
<p>If you think about what you&#8217;ll be doing to your intermediary trees, replacing
leaves with more useful objects, <code>simple</code> really makes good sense, 
since it will stop you from matching entire subtrees.</p>
<h3>Matching Repetitions and Sequences</h3>
<p>Some patterns (like repetitions and sequences) produce arrays of objects as
result. You can use <code>simple(...)</code> to replace all parts of these
arrays with your own objects, but you cannot replace the array as a whole. 
This is the purpose of <code>sequence(symbol)</code>:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  sequence(:x)
</code></pre>
<p>will match all of these:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  ['a', 'b', 'c']
  ['a', 'a', 'a']
  [Foo.new, Bar.new]
</code></pre>
<p>but not</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  [{:a =&gt; :b}]
  [['a', 'b']]
</code></pre>
<p>Like its smaller brother, <code>sequence</code> is very picky about what it
consumes and what not. All for the same reasons.</p>
<h3>Matching entire subtrees</h3>
<p>So you don&#8217;t want to listen and really want that big gun with the foot aiming
addon. You&#8217;ll be needing <code>subtree(symbol)</code>. It always matches. 
Nuff said.</p>
<h3>Matching context</h3>
<p>A match always binds in a context. The context consists of all bindings
that were previously made. If you reuse the same symbol for two consecutive
matches within the same pattern, the engine will assume that you want these
two matched objects to be equal (under <code>==</code>). This allows to 
specify constraints on your matches that would need code to express otherwise:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  # The following code is an excerpt from example/simple_xml.rb in the distro
  t.rule(
    open: {name: simple(:tag)}, 
    close: {name: simple(:tag)}, 
    inner: simple(:t)
  ) { 'verified' }
</code></pre>
<p>This replaces <em>matching</em> open and close tags with the word &#8216;verified&#8217;,
consuming them from the tree and allowing the same rule to match higher up. A
valid <span class="caps">XML</span> tree will leave only the word &#8216;verified&#8217; behind, while the parser
will stop at the problem nodes in invalid trees.</p>
<h2>Transformation rules</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we&#8217;ll look more closely at transformation rules and the
different ways they can be laid out in your code.</p>
<h3>Usage Patterns</h3>
<p>The way the transformation engine is constructed, there is not one, but three
ways to use it. Since at least one of those is inconvenient for you, the user,
I am going to show only the remaining two, Variant 1 that produces an instance
of the transform for direct use:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  # Variant 1
  transform = Parslet::Transform.new do
    rule(...) { ... } 
    rule(...) { ... } 
    rule(...) { ... } 
  end
  transform.apply(tree)
</code></pre>
<p>and Variant 2 that allows constructing the transformation as a class:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  # Variant 2
  class MyTransform &lt; Parslet::Transform
    rule(...) { ... } 
    rule(...) { ... } 
    rule(...) { ... } 
  end
  MyTransform.new.apply(tree)
</code></pre>
<p>I guess both have their sweet spot.</p>
<h3>Action blocks: Two flavors</h3>
<p>As you might have noticed by now, parslet provides choice as well as nice
parsers. To recap: Rules have a left side called <em>pattern</em> and a right side 
called <em>action block</em>:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  rule(PATTERN) {ACTION_BLOCK}
</code></pre>
<p>There are two ways of writing action blocks, and the difference might be 
fundamental to know to you one day. If written like this:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  rule(:foo =&gt; simple(:x)) { puts x }
</code></pre>
<p>the block will be able to access <code>x</code> as a local variable. This is 
very convenient and shortens the action code, often to the point of being
very expressive.</p>
<p>But there is a <em>big downside</em> to this way of writing things: The action block
must be executed in the context of some magic instance that has <code>x</code>
as a local method (aka accessor). You can only have one self at any one time; 
variable access to the binding of the block isn&#8217;t possible inside this kind
of action blocks:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  y = 12
  rule(:foo =&gt; simple(:x)) { Integer(x) + y }
</code></pre>
<p>This will (depending on the context) throw a <code>NameError</code> or a
<code>NoMethodError</code>.</p>
<p>But this can be fixed by using the other, less elegant style for action
blocks:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  y = 12
  rule(:foo =&gt; simple(:x)) { |dictionary| Integer(dictionary[:x]) + y }
</code></pre>
<p>In this second flavor, the block gets executed in the context of definition, 
whatever that was. This means that it can capture and access local variables
just fine. Access to the bindings (called <code>dictionary</code> here) is 
more clumsy, but hey, you can&#8217;t have your cake and eat it too, I guess. Even 
though that is a pity.</p>
<h2>A word on patterns</h2>
<p>Given the <span class="caps">PORO</span> hash</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  { 
    :dog =&gt; 'terrier', 
    :cat =&gt; 'suit' }
</code></pre>
<p>one might assume that the following rule matches <code>:dog</code> and
replaces it by <code>'foo'</code>:</p>
<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  rule(:dog =&gt; 'terrier') { 'foo' }
</code></pre>
<p>This is frankly impossible. How would <code>'foo'</code> live besides
<code>:cat =&gt; 'suit'</code> inside the hash? It cannot. This is why hashes are
either matched completely, cats n&#8217; all, or not at all.</p>
<p>Transformations are there for one thing: Getting out of the hash/array/slice
mess parslet creates (on purpose) into the realm of your own beautifully
crafted <span class="caps">AST</span> classes. Such
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><span class="caps">AST</span></a> nodes will generally
correspond 1:1 to hashes inside your intermediary tree.</p>
<p>If transformations get you into a mess, remember this simple truth: They have
been designed for the above purpose. Abusing them is fun (and almost all the
examples in the project do so) but the mess you get when you do is all yours.</p>
<p>If you are really desperate, try to look at the example in <a href="get-started.html">Get Started</a> or at the parser in the sample project
<a href="https://github.com/kschiess/wt">wt</a>. Imitating them would be a good first step. And if all else fails, we&#8217;re there for you, see the &#8216;Contact&#8217; section in <a href="contribute.html">Contribute</a>.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This concludes this (three part) introduction to parslet and leaves you with a
good knowledge of most tricky parts. If you are missing some detail, maybe
you can find it in the texts referenced <a href="documentation.html">here</a>? There is 
also an entire page on the tricks useful in practice here: <a href="tricks.html">Tricks</a>.</p>
<p>If not, please tell us about it. We&#8217;ll include it in this documentation in no 
time.</p></div>
