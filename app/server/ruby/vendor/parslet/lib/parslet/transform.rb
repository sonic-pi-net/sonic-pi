# Transforms an expression tree into something else. The transformation
# performs a depth-first, post-order traversal of the expression tree. During
# that traversal, each time a rule matches a node, the node is replaced by the
# result of the block associated to the rule. Otherwise the node is accepted
# as is into the result tree.
#
# This is almost what you would generally do with a tree visitor, except that
# you can match several levels of the tree at once. 
#
# As a consequence of this, the resulting tree will contain pieces of the
# original tree and new pieces. Most likely, you will want to transform the
# original tree wholly, so this isn't a problem.
#
# You will not be able to create a loop, given that each node will be replaced
# only once and then left alone. This means that the results of a replacement
# will not be acted upon. 
#
# Example: 
#
#   class Example < Parslet::Transform
#     rule(:string => simple(:x)) {  # (1)
#       StringLiteral.new(x)
#     }
#   end
#
# A tree transform (Parslet::Transform) is defined by a set of rules. Each
# rule can be defined by calling #rule with the pattern as argument. The block
# given will be called every time the rule matches somewhere in the tree given
# to #apply. It is passed a Hash containing all the variable bindings of this
# pattern match. 
#   
# In the above example, (1) illustrates a simple matching rule. 
#
# Let's say you want to parse matching parentheses and distill a maximum nest
# depth. You would probably write a parser like the one in example/parens.rb;
# here's the relevant part: 
#
#   rule(:balanced) {
#     str('(').as(:l) >> balanced.maybe.as(:m) >> str(')').as(:r)
#   }
#
# If you now apply this to a string like '(())', you get a intermediate parse
# tree that looks like this: 
#
#   {
#     l: '(', 
#     m: {
#       l: '(', 
#       m: nil, 
#       r: ')' 
#     }, 
#     r: ')' 
#   }
#
# This parse tree is good for debugging, but what we would really like to have
# is just the nesting depth. This transformation rule will produce that: 
#
#   rule(:l => '(', :m => simple(:x), :r => ')') { 
#     # innermost :m will contain nil
#     x.nil? ? 1 : x+1
#   }
#
# = Usage patterns
#
# There are four ways of using this class. The first one is very much
# recommended, followed by the second one for generality. The other ones are
# omitted here. 
#
# Recommended usage is as follows: 
#
#   class MyTransformator < Parslet::Transform
#     rule(...) { ... }
#     rule(...) { ... }
#     # ...
#   end
#   MyTransformator.new.apply(tree)
#
# Alternatively, you can use the Transform class as follows: 
#
#   transform = Parslet::Transform.new do
#     rule(...) { ... }
#   end
#   transform.apply(tree)
#
# = Execution context
#
# The execution context of action blocks differs depending on the arity of 
# said blocks. This can be confusing. It is however somewhat intentional. You 
# should not create fat Transform descendants containing a lot of helper methods, 
# instead keep your AST class construction in global scope or make it available
# through a factory. The following piece of code illustrates usage of global
# scope: 
#
#   transform = Parslet::Transform.new do
#     rule(...) { AstNode.new(a_variable) }
#     rule(...) { Ast.node(a_variable) } # modules are nice
#   end
#   transform.apply(tree)
#
# And here's how you would use a class builder (a factory):
#
#   transform = Parslet::Transform.new do
#     rule(...) { builder.add_node(a_variable) }
#     rule(...) { |d| d[:builder].add_node(d[:a_variable]) }
#   end
#   transform.apply(tree, :builder => Builder.new)
#
# As you can see, Transform allows you to inject local context for your rule
# action blocks to use. 
#
