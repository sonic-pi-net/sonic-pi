h2. Matching EOF (End Of File)

Ahh Sir, you'll be needin what us parsers call _epsilon_: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  rule(:eof) { any.absent? }
</code></pre>

Of course, most of us don't use this at all, since any parser has EOF as
implicit last input.

h2. Matching Strings Case Insensitive

Parslet is fully hackable: You can use code to create parsers easily. Here's
how I would match a string in case insensitive manner: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="case insensitive match">
  def stri(str)
    key_chars = str.split(//)
    key_chars.
      collect! { |char| match["#{char.upcase}#{char.downcase}"] }.
      reduce(:>>)
  end

  # Constructs a parser using a Parser Expression Grammar 
  stri('keyword').parse "kEyWoRd"     # => "kEyWoRd"@0
</code></pre>

h2. Testing

Parslet helps you to create parsers that are in turn created out of many small
parsers. It is really turtles all the way down. Imagine you have a complex 
parser: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  class ComplexParser < Parslet::Parser
    root :lots_of_stuff
  
    rule(:lots_of_stuff) { ... }
  
    # and many lines later: 
    rule(:simple_rule) { str('a') }
  end
</code></pre>

Also imagine that the parser (as a whole) fails to consume the 'a' that 
<code>simple_rule</code> is talking about. 

This kind of problem can very often be fixed by bisecting it into two possible
problems. Either: 

# the <code>lots_of_stuff</code> rule somehow doesn't place <code>simple_rule</code>
  in the right context or
# the <code>simple_rule</code> simply (hah!) fails to match its input. 

I find it very useful in this situation to eliminate 2. from our options: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="rspec">
  require 'rspec'
  require 'parslet/rig/rspec'
  
  class ComplexParser < Parslet::Parser
    rule(:simple_rule) { str('a') }
  end

  describe ComplexParser  do
    let(:parser) { ComplexParser.new }
    context "simple_rule" do
      it "should consume 'a'" do
        parser.simple_rule.should parse('a')
      end 
    end
  end
  
  RSpec::Core::Runner.run([])
</code></pre>

Output is: 
<pre class="output">

Example::ComplexParser
  simple_rule
    should consume 'a'

Finished in 0.00115 seconds
1 example, 0 failures
</pre>

Parslet parsers have one method per rule. These methods return valid parsers
for a subset of your grammar. 

h2. Error reports

If your grammar fails and you're aching to know why, here's a bit of exception
handling code that will help you out: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="exception handling">
  parser = str('foo')
  begin
    parser.parse('bar')
  rescue Parslet::ParseFailed => error
    puts error.cause.ascii_tree
  end
</code></pre>

This should print something akin to: 

<pre class="output"> 
Expected "foo", but got "bar" at line 1 char 1.
</pre>

These error reports are probably the fastest way to know exactly where you
went wrong (or where your input is wrong, which is aequivalent).

And since this is such a common idiom, we provide you with a shortcut: to
get the above, just: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
require 'parslet/convenience'
parser.parse_with_debug(input)
</code></pre>


h3. Reporter engines

Note that there is currently not one, but two error reporting engines! The 
default engine will report errors in a structure that looks exactly like the
grammar structure: 

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="error reporter 1">
  class P < Parslet::Parser
    root(:body)
    rule(:body) { elements }
    rule(:elements) { (call | element).repeat(2) }
    rule(:element) { str('bar') }
    rule(:call) { str('baz') >> str('()') }
  end
  
  begin
    P.new.parse('barbaz')
  rescue Parslet::ParseFailed => error
    puts error.cause.ascii_tree
  end
</code></pre>

Outputs: 

<pre class="output"> 
Expected at least 2 of CALL / ELEMENT at line 1 char 1.
`- Expected one of [CALL, ELEMENT] at line 1 char 4.
   |- Failed to match sequence ('baz' '()') at line 1 char 7.
   |  `- Premature end of input at line 1 char 7.
   `- Expected "bar", but got "baz" at line 1 char 4.
</pre>

Let's switch out the 'grammar structure' engine (called '<code>Tree</code>')
with the 'deepest error position' engine:

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code title="error reporter 2">
  class P < Parslet::Parser
    root(:body)
    rule(:body) { elements }
    rule(:elements) { (call | element).repeat(2) }
    rule(:element) { str('bar') }
    rule(:call) { str('baz') >> str('()') }
  end
  
  begin
    P.new.parse('barbaz', reporter: Parslet::ErrorReporter::Deepest.new)
  rescue Parslet::ParseFailed => error
    puts error.cause.ascii_tree
  end
</code></pre>

Outputs: 

<pre class="output"> 
Expected at least 2 of CALL / ELEMENT at line 1 char 1.
`- Expected one of [CALL, ELEMENT] at line 1 char 4.
   |- Failed to match sequence ('baz' '()') at line 1 char 7.
   |  `- Premature end of input at line 1 char 7.
   `- Premature end of input at line 1 char 7.
</pre>

The <code>'Deepest'</code> position engine will store errors that are the
farthest into the input. In some examples, this produces more readable output
for the end user. 

h2. Line numbers from parser output

A traditional parser would parse and then perform several checking phases,
like for example verifying all type constraints are respected in the input.
During this checking phase, you will most likely want to report screens full
of type errors back to the user ('cause that's what types are for, right?).
Now where did that 'int' come from?

Parslet gives you slices (Parslet::Slice) of input as part of your tree. These
are essentially strings with line numbers. Here's how to print that error
message:

<pre class="sh_ruby"><code>
  # assume that type == "int"@0 - a piece from your parser output
  line, col = type.line_and_column
  puts "Sorry. Can't have #{type} at #{line}:#{col}!"
</code></pre>
