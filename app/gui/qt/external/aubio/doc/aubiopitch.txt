NAME
  aubiopitch - a command line tool to extract musical pitch

SYNOPSIS

  aubiopitch source
  aubiopitch [[-i] source] [-o sink]
             [-r rate] [-B win] [-H hop]
             [-p method] [-u unit] [-l thres]
             [-T time-format]
             [-s sil] [-f]
             [-v] [-h] [-j]

DESCRIPTION

  aubiopitch attempts to detect the pitch, the perceived height of a musical
  note.

  When started with an input source (-i/--input), the detected pitch are
  printed on the console, prefixed by a timestamp in seconds. If no pitch
  candidate is found, the output is 0.

  When started without an input source, or with the jack option (-j/--jack),
  aubiopitch starts in jack mode.

OPTIONS

  This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
  starting with two dashes (--). A summary of options is included below.

  -i, --input source  Run analysis on this audio file. Most uncompressed and
  compressed are supported, depending on how aubio was built.

  -o, --output sink  Save results in this file. The file will be created on
  the model of the input file. The detected frequency is played at the
  detected loudness.

  -r, --samplerate rate  Fetch the input source, resampled at the given
  sampling rate. The rate should be specified in Hertz as an integer. If 0,
  the sampling rate of the original source will be used. Defaults to 0.

  -B, --bufsize win  The size of the buffer to analyze, that is the length
  of the window used for spectral and temporal computations. Defaults to 2048.

  -H, --hopsize hop  The number of samples between two consecutive analysis.
  Defaults to 256.

  -p, --pitch method  The pitch detection method to use. See PITCH METHODS
  below. Defaults to 'default'.

  -u, --pitch-unit unit  The unit to be used to print frequencies. Possible
  values include midi, bin, cent, and Hz. Defaults to 'Hz'.

  -l, --pitch-tolerance thres  Set the tolerance for the pitch detection
  algorithm. Typical values range between 0.2 and 0.9. Pitch candidates found
  with a confidence less than this threshold will not be selected. The higher
  the threshold, the more confidence in the candidates. Defaults to unset.

  -s, --silence sil  Set the silence threshold, in dB, under which the onset
  will not be detected. A value of -20.0 would eliminate most onsets but the
  loudest ones. A value of -90.0 would select all onsets. Defaults to -90.0.

  -T, --timeformat format  Set time format (samples, ms, seconds). Defaults to
  seconds.

  -m, --mix-input  Mix source signal to the output signal before writing to
  sink.

  -f, --force-overwrite  Overwrite output file if it already exists.

  -j, --jack  Use Jack input/output. You will need a Jack connection
  controller to feed aubio some signal and listen to its output.

  -h, --help  Print a short help message and exit.

  -v, --verbose  Be verbose.

PITCH METHODS

  Available methods are:

  default  use the default method

  Currently, the default method is set to yinfft.

  schmitt  Schmitt trigger

  This pitch extraction method implements a Schmitt trigger to estimate the
  period of a signal. It is computationally very inexpensive, but also very
  sensitive to noise.

  fcomb  a fast harmonic comb filter

  This pitch extraction method implements a fast harmonic comb filter to
  determine the fundamental frequency of a harmonic sound.

  mcomb  multiple-comb filter

  This fundamental frequency estimation algorithm implements spectral
  flattening, multi-comb filtering and peak histogramming.

  specacf  Spectral auto-correlation function

  yin  YIN algorithm

  This algorithm was developed by A. de Cheveigne and H. Kawahara and
  was first published in:

  De Cheveigné, A., Kawahara, H. (2002) "YIN, a fundamental frequency
  estimator for speech and music", J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 111, 1917-1930.

  yinfft  Yinfft algorithm

  This algorithm was derived from the YIN algorithm. In this implementation, a
  Fourier transform is used to compute a tapered square difference function,
  which allows spectral weighting. Because the difference function is tapered,
  the selection of the period is simplified.

  yinfast  YIN algorithm (accelerated)

  An optimised implementation of the YIN algorithm, yielding results identical
  to the original YIN algorithm, while reducing its computational cost from
  O(n^2) to O(n log(n)).
