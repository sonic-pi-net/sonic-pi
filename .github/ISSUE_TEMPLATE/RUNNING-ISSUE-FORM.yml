        Hello! Thank you for wanting to raise an issue for us, so that we know what's not working for you.

        Sorry you're having issues while Sonic Pi is running! We're always working to improve its behaviour.

        The core Sonic Pi development team is fairly small and made up of volunteers (with the exception of Sam Aaron, who relies much on crowd-funding) so the more help we can receive to manage, troubleshoot and hopefully fix your issues for you the better - help us to help you! Please follow the checklist below - that way you might not even need to raise an issue after all :smile:

        If you were trying to run some code when Sonic Pi behaved unexpectedly, please share a _small_ code example here that demonstrates the unexpected behaviour. (The simpler it is the better).
        Please use code formatting for the example - if you're not sure how, please see GitHub's guide: [Quoting code](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code).
