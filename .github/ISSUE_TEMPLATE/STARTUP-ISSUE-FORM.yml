        Hello! Thank you for wanting to raise an issue for us, so that we know what's not working for you.

        Sorry you're having issues getting Sonic pi to start up! We're always working to improve the success rate.

        The core Sonic Pi development team is fairly small and made up of volunteers (with the exception of Sam Aaron, who relies much on crowd-funding) so the more help we can receive to manage, troubleshoot and hopefully fix your issues for you the better - help us to help you! Please follow the checklist below - that way you might not even need to raise an issue after all :smile:

        Please paste in the error report or log file details as outlined in the troubleshooting guide.
        If the `.sonic-pi/log` directory doesn't exist, then Sonic Pi probably doesn't even load far enough to be able to create it. Please tell us if this is the case!
